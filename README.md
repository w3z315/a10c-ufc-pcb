Welcome to the repository for my very first PCB design, crafted specifically for an A-10C cockpit simulator project. This project has been a labor of love, a lot of learning, and yes, a few missteps - but that's the beauty of DIY!

## About the Project

The A-10C UFC PCB is for my custom A-10C cockpit control panel. You can read all about my journey [on my blog](https://mahrt.io/diy-a-10c-upfront-control-panel-pcb/).
