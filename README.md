# A-10C Upfront Control Panel (UFC) PCB
![blinky](./img/ufc_wip.gif)

Welcome to the repository for my very first PCB design, crafted specifically for an A-10C cockpit simulator project. This project has been a labor of love, a lot of learning, and yes, a few missteps - but that's the beauty of DIY!

## Sponsorship
Thank you so much [PCBWay.com](https://pcbway.com) for sponsoring this project! I was genuinely surprised by how quickly the PCBs arrived - in just 9 days, without even opting for the very express shipping variant. The quality is outstanding, and the PCBs work flawlessly in my setup. It's been a fantastic experience, from design submission to receiving the boards ready for assembly.

## About the Project

The A-10C UFC PCB is for my custom A-10C cockpit control panel. You can read all about my journey [on my blog](https://mahrt.io/diy-a-10c-upfront-control-panel-pcb/).
